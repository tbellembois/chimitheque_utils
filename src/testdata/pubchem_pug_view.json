PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 Â°C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 Â°C or 68 Â°F] for gases).",

Modeling of the data produced the significant outcome that lung burden data for both species followed a time-dependent decline in the deposition rates in the middle and high exposure groups but not in the low exposure group. Total lung doses were not proportional to exposure concentrations and for each species, by the end of 18 months, the overall lung doses in the lower two exposure concentrations were almost identical.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Almost all chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma are caused by complicated interactions between gene and environment. One of the major hallmarks of those diseases is airway mucus overproduction (MO). Excessive mucus causes airway obstruction and significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Metals are major components of environmental particulate matters (PM). Among them, vanadium has been suggested to play an important role in PM-induced mucin production. Vanadium pentoxide (V(2)O(5)) is the most common commercial source of vanadium, and it has been associated with occupational chronic bronchitis and asthma, both of which are MO diseases. However, the underlying mechanism is not entirely clear. In this study, we used both in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate the robust inductions of mucin production by V(2)O(5). Furthermore, the follow-up mechanistic study revealed a novel v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1-IKK-NF-kappaB pathway that mediated V(2)O(5)-induced mucin production. Most interestingly, the reactive oxygen species and the classical mucin-inducing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-MAPK pathway appeared not to be involved in this process. Thus the V(2)O(5)-induced mucin production may represent a novel EGFR-MAPK-independent and environmental toxicant-associated MO model. Complete elucidation of the signaling pathway in this model will not only facilitate the development of the treatment for V(2)O(5)-associated occupational diseases but also advance our understanding on the EGFR-independent mucin production in other chronic airway diseases.",

Treatment of myofibroblasts with V(2)O(5) resulted in the activation of ERK-1/2, yet the inert metal titanium dioxide had no effect on ERK-1/2 activation. V(2)O(5)-induced ERK-1/2 activation was abolished by pretreatment with forskolin or PD98059, indicating a dependence on Raf and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase, respectively. Depletion of conventional protein kinase C activity with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not inhibit V(2)O(5)-induced ERK-1/2 activation. ERK-1/2 activation by V(2)O(5) was inhibited >70% with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478. Phosphorylation of the 170-kD EGF-R by V(2)O(5) was detected after immunoprecipitation with an anti-EGF-R antibody followed by phosphotyrosine Western blotting. V(2)O(5) strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated a 115-kD protein (p115) and activation of p115 was inhibited 60 to 70% by AG1478, indicating that this protein was an EGF-R substrate. Phosphorylation of p115 was also observed in EGF-stimulated cells. Immunoprecipitation of V(2)O(5)- or EGF-treated cell lysates with an antibody against Src homology 2 protein tyrosine phosphatase (SH-PTP2) identified p115 as a SH-PTP2-binding protein. Pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine blocked V(2)O(5)-induced MAP kinase activation and p115 phosphorylation >90%. These data suggest that V(2)O(5) activation of ERK-1/2 is oxidant-dependent and mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R and an EGF-R substrate which we identified as a 115-kD SH-PTP2-binding protein.",

These changes include airway smooth muscle cell thickening, mucous cell metaplasia, and airway fibrosis. The transient appearance of peribronchiolar myofibroblasts, which were desmin and vimentin positive, coincided with a twofold increase in the thickness of the airway smooth muscle layer at day 6 after instillation and preceded the development of airway fibrosis by day 15. The number of nuclear profiles within the smooth muscle layer also increased twofold after V(2)O(5) instillation, suggesting that hyperplasia accounted for thickening of the smooth muscle layer. The majority of cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridine at day 3 were located in the connective tissue surrounding the airway smooth muscle wall that was positive for vimentin and desmin. These data suggest that myofibroblasts are the principal proliferating cell type that contributes to the progression of airway fibrosis after V(2)O(5) injury.",

Minor amounts are used in the production of oxalic acid from cellulose and of anthraquinone from anthracene.  V2O5 is used to lower the melting point of enamel frits for the coating of aluminum substrates. FeV and VAl master alloys are preferably produced from V2O5 fused flakes due to the low loss on ignition, low sulfur and dust contents, and high density of the molten oxide compared to powder.  Further uses of V2O5 are as a corrosion inhibitor in the CO2 scrubbing solutions of the Benfield and related processes for the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons, as cathode in primary and secondary (rechargeable) lithium batteries, as UV absorbent in glass, in YVO4: Eu3+ red phosphors for high-pressure mercury lamps and TV screens, for glazes, for yellow (SnO2/V2O5) and blue (ZrO2/V2O5) pigments, as colloidal solution for antistatic layers on photographic material, and as a starting material for the production of carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, silicides, halides, vanadates, and vanadium salts.",

This mixture is roasted at ca 850 Â°C and the oxides are converted to water-soluble sodium metavanadate, NaVO3. The vanadium is extracted by leaching with water and precipitates at pH 2-3 as sodium hexavanadate, Na4V6O17, a red cake, by the addition of sulfuric acid. This is then fused at 700 Â°C to yield a dense black product which is sold as technical-grade vanadium pentoxide. This product contains a minimum of 86 wt % V2O5 and a maximum of 6-10 wt % Na2O. The red cake can be further purified by dissolving it in an aqueous solution of Na2CO3. The iron, aluminum, and silicon impurities precipitate from the solution upon pH adjustment. Ammonium metavanadate then precipitates upon the addition of NH4Cl and is calcined to give vanadium pentoxide of greater than 99.8% purity.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this odorless, yellow-to-orange, crystalline substance may occur from its use as an intermediate for vanadium alloys and compounds, as an oxidation catalyst (eg, in manufacture of sulfuric acid, and in automobile catalytic converters), in photographic development, in dyeing textiles, in ceramic coloring, from vanadium mining and processing, and from the cleaning of oil-fired boilers, combustion chambers, gas turbines, and firebrick linings. Effects from exposure may include burns to the skin and eyes,tracheitis, bronchitis, emphysema, pulmonary edema, or bronchial pneumonia. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has established a threshold limit value time-weighted average (TLV TWA) of 0.05 mg/cu m for vanadium fume and respirable dust (as vanadium pentoxide). Engineering controls (including process enclosure and exhaust ventilation) should be used to limit vanadium pentoxide exposure. In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear protective clothing specifically recommended by the shipper or producer to prevent skin contact with vanadium pentoxide, and a self-contained breathing apparatus. Safety showers and eyewash fountains should be located in areas where exposures are likely. If contact should occur, flush exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin with soap and water. Contaminated clothing should be removed and left at the work site for cleaning. While vanadium pentoxide does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of acrid smoke and fumes. Also, containers may explode in the heat of a fire. For fires involving vanadium pentoxide, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Fight the fire from a maximum distance, and dike fire control water to prevent the material from entering water sources or sewers. Vanadium pentoxide should be stored in tightly closed containers, away from moisture, heat, sparks, or flames, and incompatibles such as chlorine trifluoride, lithium, or peroxyformic acid. Vanadium pentoxide may be shipped domestically via air, rail, road, or water. Small spills of vanadium pentoxide may be collected and placed in clean, dry containers for later disposal (liquid solutions are taken up with sand or noncombustible absorbent). Large spills on land should be contained in excavated pits or other holding areas. Solids should be covered with a plastic sheet. Spills into bodies of water should be neutralized with agricultural lime, crushed limestone, or sodium bicarbonate, and mechanical dredges used to remove immobilized masses.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Vanadium pentoxide is used in ceramics and as a catalyst as well as in the production of superconductive magnets. Vanadium pentoxide is also used as a catalyst in dye mordants, paint and varnish drying, glass and ink manufacture, pesticides, and photographic chemicals. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: It is a confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans. The main signs and symptoms of intoxication caused by single iv doses of the order of 100 mg vanadium pentoxide included nausea, vomiting, salivation, and lacrimation, disappearance of pulse, and cylindrical casts and albumin in the urine. Men exposed to vanadium pentoxide while cleaning oil-fired burners or gas-fired turbines had symptoms consisting of cough, wheezing, rhinitis, sneezing, nosebleeds, sore throat, fatigue, nervousness, eye irritation, hoarseness, and chest pain. Workers exposed to vanadium pentoxide for only a few days may develop irritation of the conjunctivae, rhinitis, dryness of the throat, hoarseness, bronchitis with coughing and wheezing, dyspnea, and pneumonitis. A green-black discoloration of the tongue sometimes occurs. Inhalation of vanadium pentoxide for 1-5 yr produced asthma in 3 of 20 workers. In human leukocytes V(2)O(5) causes oxidation of DNA bases, affects DNA repair, and induces formation of micronucleus, nucleoplasmic bridges, and nuclear buds, suggesting that the workers are at increased risk for cancer and other diseases that are related to DNA instability. It is also induced single-strand DNA breaks in human lymphocytes. Vanadium workers are more susceptible to colds and other respiratory illnesses than others. Exposure to vanadium may impair the lung resistance to respiratory infection. ANIMAL STUDIES: Rabbits were exposed to vanadium pentoxide dust at concentrations of 77, 109, 205, and 525 mg/cu m for 7, 4, 4, and 1 hours, respectively. On autopsy, the animals exhibited chronic inflammatory changes in the nasal and tracheal mucosa, slight emphysema of the lungs, bronchopneumonic patches, pyelonephritis, and hepatitis. In rats 1 hr exposures to vanadium pentoxide pulverized dust at 80 mg/cu m caused acute intoxication. Acute inhalation toxicity in rats was characterized by an irritation of the respiratory mucosa and nasal discharge that sometimes contained blood. Autopsy showed severe congestion and small hemorrhages in all internal organs, signs of increased intracranial pressure, and fatty degeneration of the liver. In the lungs, there was capillary congestion, edema, bronchitis, and focal interstitial pneumonia. Administration of 10 mg/kg bw to mice causes hindlimb paralysis, increased reflex excitability, and GI tract upsets. Gross pathology examination revealed congestion and capillary stasis in the visceral organs. Rats and mice were exposed via inhalation six hours/day, five days/week for three months at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 mg/cu m. In male mice vanadium accumulates in the testes starting with the initial inhalation (24 hr). In general, vanadium was capable of significantly decreasing the percentage of gamma-tubulin in all analyzed testicular cells (Sertoli, Leydig, and germ cells) starting with the first week of treatment. There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of implantation sites, live fetuses, and fetal weight among the progeny of the exposed mice compared to controls. There was a statistically significant increase in resorptions and dead fetuses among the females mated with exposed males compared to those mated to controls. In other study, there was a statistically significant decrease in skeletal ossification among the fetuses of mice exposed on day eight. In addition, 6 of 106 exposed fetuses and one of the controls had broken spinal cords. Inhalation of vanadium pentoxide clearly increases the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms in male and female mice at all concentrations tested (1, 2, or 4 mg/cu m). V(2)O(5) exposure was a pulmonary carcinogen in male rats and male and female mice. Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity test protocol conducted with multiple strains of S. typhimurium with and without metabolic activation enzymes and cofactors were negative. However, REC assay suggested that vanadium pentoxide caused DNA damage at 0.5 umol (91 ug/mL). The selective immunotoxic effects (depression of phagocytosis, splenotoxicity enlargement of spleen, elevation of peripheral blood leukocytes, and T-and B-cell activation) were observed in rats given vanadium pentoxide in drinking water for 6 months, and mice given vanadium pentoxide in water 5 days a week for 6 weeks. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The 96-hr LC50 of vanadium pentoxide to adult American flagfish (J. floridae) was 11.2 mg/L in very hard water. Larvae showed 28-day LC50 of 1.13 and 1.88 mg/L of vanadium with larger larvae being more resistant.",

The pentavalent form of vanadium, vanadate, is a potent inhibitor of the Ca+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase of plasma membranes, which decreases intracellular ATP concentration. Vanadium is also believed to induce the production of reactive oxygen species. This may damage DNA and also cause oxidative stress, which can damage the reproductive system. Vanadium also inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatases, producing insulin-like effects. (L837, A247, A248, A249, A250, A251)",

To assess the anti-allergic activity of natural vanadium-containing Jeju groundwater (JW), an in vivo passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) animal model and in vitro mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) was used. JW inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) generation in a dose-dependent manner, with a concomitant reduction of COX-2 protein expression in IgE-induced BMMCs. In addition, JW inhibited 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-dependent generation of leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) as well as degranulation in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that JW has dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitory activity. In addition, vanadium pentoxide (V(2)O(5)), which is the major vanadium component of JW, also inhibited PGD(2) and LTC(4) generation as well as degranulation in IgE-induced BMMCs. Furthermore, oral administration of JW dose-dependently inhibited mast cell-dependent passive anaphylactic reaction in IgE-sensitized mice. Taken together, these results suggest that JW may be useful in regulating mast cell-mediated allergic response through the suppression of eicosanoid generation and degranulation in mast cells.",

Serum or Plasma Reference Ranges: Normal - less than 0.24 ug/L; Exposed - not established; Toxic - not established. Urine Reference Ranges: Normal - 0.06 to 0.87 ug/L; Exposed - Workers exposed to average 8 hr air concentrations of 6.0 to 6.4 mg/cu m had urine vanadium levels between 2.6 to 4.6 ug/L in specimens that were collected at the start of the next work day. BAT for vanadium pentoxide (sampling time for long term exposures: after several shifts, measured as vanadium): 70 ug/g creatinine; Toxic - In a study involving controlled human exposure to vanadium pentoxide, where levels caused development of mild respiratory effects, the peak urine vanadium level was 130 ug/L at 3 days after exposure. /Vanadium/",

Severe respiratory irritation was the most prevalent symptom, but slight changes in blood, hemoglobin concentrations, heart palpitations upon exertion, weakness and neuroasthenic symptoms were observed occasionally. Blood pressure was not increased and there were no gastrointestinal or urinary tract symptoms and no discoloration of the tongue; chronic changes, such as pneumonoconiosis, fibrosis or emphysema, were not detected.",

Herein, we assessed the toxicological effects of two types of in-house synthesized vanadium oxide NPs in Wistar rats exposed to NPs through inhalation route. V2O5 and VO2 NPs exhibited rod and spherical symmetry, respectively, with a mean diameter of 50 +/- 20 and 30 +/- 10 nm. Assessment of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid parameters demonstrated that VO2 NP-exposed animals had higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase as compared to V2O5 NP-exposed animals. The levels of oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione also indicated higher toxic potential of VO2 NPs. Moreover, after a 7-day recovery, the levels of the above parameters were closer to normal levels only in V2O5-exposed animals. Interestingly, histopathological and immune-histopathology analysis (TNF-alpha) of lung tissue showed higher damage and inflammatory response in VO2 NP-exposed animals, which persisted even after 7 days of recovery period. Surprisingly, the carcinogenic potential of vanadium oxide NPs came into light which was indicated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay as well as the decreased levels of p53 and Bax, in lung tissue of NP-exposed animals. Notably, the physiochemical characterization of NPs, especially the shape and the size, play a central role in shaping the toxicity of these NPs and thus should be extensively evaluated for outlining the regulatory guidelines.",

Larvae showed 28-day LC50 of 1.13 and 1.88 mg/L of vanadium with larger larvae being more resistant. These appeared to be thresholds of lethality. During continuous exposure for 96 days, larval growth and survival were the most sensitive indicators of vanadium toxicity and were marginally reduced at 0.17 mg/L. At 0.041 mg/L, there were no deleterious sublethal effects but there was definite stimulation of growth in females and of reproductive performance. The threshold for chronic toxicity was judged to be about 0.08 mg/L. The safe-to-lethal ratio was 0.007 and this could be used as an application factor for other species. There was no clear evidence that vanadium had any long-term cumulative toxicity.",

Research on biological influence of vanadium pentoxide has gained major importance because it exerts toxic effects on a wide variety of biological systems. In this work ...the effects of vanadium pentoxide ranging from 0 to 2 mM in culture media on a wine wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae from Alentejo region of Portugal /are evaluated/. ...Results show that 2.0 mM vanadium pentoxide in culture medium induced a significant increase of malonaldehyde level and Glutathione peroxidase activity, a slight increase of Catalase A activity as well as a decrease of wet weight and mitochondrial NADH cit c reductase of S. cerevisiae UE-ME(3). Also... results show that cycloheximide prevent cell death when cells grow 30 min in presence of 1.5 mM of vanadium pentoxide.",

Seven males and three females exposed to 16 mg/cu m died during the study. Mean body weights were significantly less in males exposed to 4 mg/cu m or greater and in females exposed to 16 mg/cu m. Abnormal breathing, thinness, lethargy, abnormal posture, and ruffled fur were observed in rats exposed to 16 mg/cu m. Hematology results indicated that exposure of rats to vanadium pentoxide induced a microcytic erythrocytosis in males and females. Absolute and relative lung weights were significantly greater for 4 mg/cu m or greater males and females than for the chamber controls as were the relative lung weights of 2 mg/cu m males. The estrous cycle of females exposed to 8 mg/cu m was significantly longer than that of the chamber control group, and the number of cycling females in the 16 mg/cu m group was reduced. The incidences of several nonneoplastic lesions of the lung and nose were significantly increased in males and females exposed to 2 mg/cu m or greater.

During the 1970s domestic USA sources (mine production and recovery) have been largely confined to four states, Colorado, Arkansas, Idaho, and Utah. The chief vanadium ores in uranium-bearing sandstones are carnotite (K2O.2UO3.V2O5.3H2O), roscoelite (CaO.3V2O5.9H2O), and vanadinite (Pb(PbCl)(V2O4)). In all, more than 65 vanadium ores have been described, but all except 5 or 6 are of secondary origin formed by oxidation or weathering. Other potential sources are weathered shale, 1% vanadium pentoxide, and oil crudes, up to 3.72 ug vanadium/mL.",

Generally, lower oxides formed during combustion of coal and residual fuel oils, such as vanadium trioxide, undergo further oxidation to the pentoxide form, often before leaving the stacks. The average residence time for vanadium in the atmosphere is unknown as the particle size varies considerably. An estimated residence time of about 1 day has been proposed for the settling of fly ash vanadium pentoxide when associated with hydrogen sulfate. Smaller particles, such as those emitted from oil-fired power plants, have a longer residence time in the atmosphere and are more likely to be transported farther away from the source. Vanadium transported within the atmosphere is eventually transferred to soil and water on the earth's surface by wet and dry deposition(1).",
